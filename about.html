    <h1>About O Farms Realty</h1>
    <p>
      At O Farms Realty, we don’t just deal in land-we deal in vision, trust, and long-term prosperity. Our journey began over 30 years ago, when our founder, Maroof Ahmed, recognized the untapped potential of farm land. We built O Farms Realty from the ground up, driven by a deep understanding of land investments and a keen ability to spot opportunities before they became valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, we have acquired, developed, and successfully sold over 250+ acres of land in rapidly growing locations such as Nandi Hills, Devanahalli, Harohalli, and Hindupur. Long before these areas became sought-after investment destinations, we saw their potential and helped our clients secure valuable land at the right time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But our expertise goes beyond large-scale agricultural projects. We have also completed several smaller real estate developments in Bangalore city, including land acquisitions, apartment complexes, and other property ventures. For over a decade, we’ve advised friends, family, and close associates, helping them navigate the complex world of real estate. Through our guidance, we have successfully protected investors from fraudulent deals and saved them crores of rupees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Navigating the real estate industry is never easy. We’ve encountered every challenge possible-litigation battles, legal roadblocks, market fluctuations, and regulatory complexities. Through resilience, experience, and deep industry knowledge, we have overcome every obstacle, ensuring that our clients never face the same mistakes we did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our primary expertise lies in agricultural land investments around Bangalore, as this is where we have spent decades honing our skills. However, our experience in urban real estate also allows us to guide investors in residential, commercial, and mixed-use property investments. Whether it’s securing the perfect piece of land, understanding zoning laws, or avoiding common pitfalls, we provide insights that come from real, hands-on experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond business, we believe in responsible land development. Over the years, we’ve taken active steps toward sustainability, planting over 5,000 trees across our projects. We understand that land isn’t just an asset-it’s a responsibility, and we are committed to preserving it for future generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      At O Farms Realty, we don’t just sell land-we build futures, wealth, and trust. And now, with over three decades of experience, we want to use everything we've learned-including the mistakes we’ve made and the obstacles we’ve faced-to help our clients avoid costly errors. Whether you’re a first-time investor looking to get started or a seasoned investor who just needs a second opinion, we’re here to make sure your real estate decisions are informed, secure, and profitable.
